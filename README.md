Approximation of the Schrödinger Equation of 2D Materials
This repository provides the foundation for solving the Schrödinger equation of 2D materials. The approach is based on Bloch theory, with the potential term modeled using a generalized Kronig-Penney model.


The Schrödinger equation for the Hamiltonian is:
